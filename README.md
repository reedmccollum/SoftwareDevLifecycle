# SoftwareDevLifecycle

This is an example of a Scrum-agile Sprint Review and Retrospective for a project. It provides details into the my methods of interpretting user needs, and expanding upon them to make them user stories. These user stories would be given to developement teams who would intepret the user stories to develop a product dynamically suited for a client. All of this is accomplished with open communication across the team.
